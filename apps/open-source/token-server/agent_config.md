## Function Calling Setup

Your LiveKit agent should be configured to make HTTP calls to these endpoints:

### Check Availability
```python
POST https://newport-rentals.onrender.com/api/agent/check-availability
{
    "date": "2024-08-26",
    "duration": 60
}
```

### Book Appointment  
```python
POST https://newport-rentals.onrender.com/api/agent/book-appointment
{
    "guest_name": "John Smith",
    "guest_phone": "+15551234567", 
    "start_time": "2024-08-26T14:00:00-07:00",
    "end_time": "2024-08-26T15:00:00-07:00",
    "guest_email": "john@email.com",
    "description": "Property viewing appointment"
}
```

### Get Available Dates
```python
GET https://newport-rentals.onrender.com/api/agent/available-dates
```

## Agent Conversation Flow Examples

**Scenario 1: Guest wants to schedule**
```
Guest: "Can I schedule a time to see the property?"
Agent: "Absolutely! I can help you schedule a property viewing. What day would work best for you?"
Guest: "How about this Thursday?"
Agent: [Calls check_availability for Thursday]
Agent: "I have these times available on Thursday: 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 4:00 PM. Which works best for you?"
Guest: "2 PM sounds perfect"
Agent: "Great choice! To book your 2 PM appointment on Thursday, I'll need your full name and phone number."
Guest: "John Smith, and my number is 555-123-4567"
Agent: [Calls book_appointment]
Agent: "Perfect! I've scheduled your property viewing for Thursday at 2:00 PM. You'll receive a confirmation shortly. Is there anything specific about the property you'd like me to prepare for your visit?"
```

**Scenario 2: No availability**
```
Guest: "I want to see the property tomorrow"
Agent: [Calls check_availability for tomorrow]
Agent: "I don't have any available appointment slots tomorrow. Let me suggest some other dates: [calls get_available_dates]. Would Wednesday or Friday work better for you?"
```

**Scenario 3: Email collection**
```
Agent: "I have your appointment booked! If you'd like to receive a calendar invitation and confirmation email, I can add your email address to the booking."
Guest: "Yes, it's john@email.com"
Agent: "Perfect! You'll receive a calendar invitation at john@email.com with all the details."
```

## Testing the Integration

Once deployed, test with these scenarios:
1. Call the dialer and ask to "schedule a property viewing"
2. Try different dates to see availability checking
3. Complete a full booking with name/phone
4. Test with unavailable dates
5. Verify calendar events are created in Google Calendar

## Important Notes

- Agent functions use your server's API endpoints
- All bookings are logged in both Google Calendar and Supabase database  
- Business hours are 9 AM - 6 PM, Monday-Friday
- Each appointment is 60 minutes by default
- Guest contact info is required for booking
- Email is optional but recommended for confirmations
